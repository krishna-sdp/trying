          "Anyone associated with the music industry would swear by the times before the current digital age started. Music was created, CDs were sold, royalties were obtained and paid and all was good with the world. While there was piracy in the form of bootlegged CDs, authorities could easily trace fake CDs and the loss was kept at a minimum. The creation of mp3 files ushered in the Age of Darkness and piracy became both rampant and untraceable. Websites like Napster spawned a whole new breed of piracy sites that allowed people to illegally download music for free. This led to loss of revenue for everyone who was involved in the creation of that music. While platforms like iTunes endeavored to provide legal ways to download music from the Apple Store, other “free” sites soon mushroomed and were constantly at loggerheads with the law.",
          "Many new artists in a bid to become popular overnight upload their work on social media with a view to gain virality. They also take this route due to their inherent fear of the quagmire that is the entertainment industry as it stands today. Unfortunately, on social media, they fail to establish ownership on their original pieces of work and lose it to a more influential artist or a media house and finally lose morale to produce new work. While a Taylor Swift has the clout and wherewithal to sue giant corporations for infringement of copyrights and composition rights, not every artist can afford to stand up against the media behemoths.",
          "The majority of artistes are at the mercy of the “artiste management system.” While touted as a bridge, this system is essentially an obstacle between the artist and her fans and allows only limited contact between the two and only as and when it suits the system. Today, the artist has to rely on talent agencies, event managers, studio producers and the like in order to stay relevant. And in trying to stay in the good books of these intermediaries, artistes lose focus from creating quality work of art. A result of the system’s ego-centricity and haphazard resource allocation is frustrated artists and fans alike who wait perennially for a new launch",
          "Many other aspects of the entertainment industry are also mired in inefficiencies and a lot of heartburn for those involved. These involve calculations of royalties, the excessive time required for payments, event management, ticket sales, cheating on contracts and whatnot. The time is ripe for a disruption in an industry known for its whimsical players and their idiosyncrasies.",

          "The beauty of blockchain technology lies in its simplicity. A decentralized and trustless, yet incorruptible, hyperledger (distributed ledger) that records all transactions with a definitive “time stamp” and encrypted to a level that makes faking them practically impossible. “Smart contracts” execute agreed upon contract terms and rules thereby making the entire process seamless, effortless and without the need for intermediation.",
          "A distributed ledger is a type of shared database that is synchronously replicated among all members of a network. The network is essentially decentralized, meaning there is no central controlling authority. This ledger records all transactions occurring between participants of the network. All updates on the network occur with the consensus of the participants. No central authority is involved and every transaction that occurs has a unique cryptographic signature and a timestamp that serves to authenticate it. This makes the ledger an immutable and auditable history of all transactions ever happened on the network.",
          "Blockchain technology has the ability to solve most of the current problems that plague the media and entertainment industry. For starters, it can afford robust protection from copyright infringements and make piracy practically impossible. Second, a blockchain powered platform can help artistes upload their work directly and share it with fans. Fans, using a pay-per-view or a similar model, will be able to enjoy their favorite artist's work. The artist, in turn, gets paid almost instantaneously for every view/download. Event management and ticket sales can become seamless and a lot of accountability can be afforded to the entire system.",

Singapore-based BlocForm Pte Ltd is an enterprise that aims to create a platform where artists can directly connect and communicate with their fans. Fans can get access to unique, personal content from the artists along with merchandise, giveaways, preferential tickets at events and gigs and much more.",
          "Another business that looks to disrupt the traditional celebrity-fan relationship within the entertainment industry is the Jetcoin Institute. It is a truly democratic and open platform that aims to fuel the careers of exceptional talents in the field of sports and entertainment. A talent is contracted to become a Jetcoin Champion. Part of this champion’s image rights are for sale to the fans and users of the platform. When people buy these image rights, they are monetarily supporting the rise of this talent. As the talent matures in his or her field, the value of their image rights increases. This translates into rewards for people who “invested” in the dreams and aspirations of the talent in the first place. May Myat Noe, a popular Burmese model, singer and actress is the latest Jetcoin Champion and her fans now have the opportunity to invest in her journey towards success.",
          " These are only some of the ways in which blockchain technology can transform the manufacturing industry. The true potential of this technology is yet to be unearthed. However, there are certain limitations with this technology, most important and pertinent of them being the scalability of the technology and the rate of conversion of transactions. It is only a matter of time before the rate of conversion increases exponentially as more people accept and adopt the technology in the manufacturing sector. Better ways of improving the scalability are also being developed so as to make the blockchain technology a truly revolutionary step in the next phase of the evolution of manufacturing.",
          "AdHive, an Estonian business venture, is looking to disrupt the world of media advertising by bringing marketers and video bloggers, or vloggers, on a blockchain- and AI-powered platform. The marketer puts up a project on the platform that is taken up by different vloggers. They create sponsored content and post them on their vlogs. The completion of the task with the set directives is assessed by AI while the community assesses the quality of the videos. Contracts and payments are governed by blockchain technology.",

          "If there was an award for the most revolutionary technology of the decade, blockchain technology would win it hands down for its sheer scope of application and for revolutionizing data management and recording. It has been touted as an invention almost as important and significant as the internet itself. Blockchain technology gained its reputation mainly because of the colossal rise in the popularity of the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin which spawned a whole new class of digital assets. Blockchain technology is at the base of all these cryptocurrencies. However, there is more to the technology than just cryptocurrencies and it is absolutely mind boggling as to how quickly this technology is assuming a role of importance in many areas of the global economy. With every passing day, more and more corporations and individuals are realizing the worth of its awesome capabilities and are investing in this technology in one way or the other.",

          "The blockchain technology is a way of recording the data in an immutable manner in a decentralized and democratic network of computers. It ensures permanency and authenticity of the data, which means that any data recorded on the blockchain becomes permanent in the truest sense and that the data hasn’t been manipulated and falsely recorded. Also, blockchain technology brings along with it an extremely vast scope of application. From simple record keeping to identity management to facilitating funding, this technology can be applied to almost all aspects of human endeavor. Large scale applications of the blockchain technology are being developed for many sectors and industries which could do away with the obsolete manner of record management which primarily uses a central database stored in a server requiring additional layers of encryption which can still be hacked and tampered with, along with the possibility of data theft and loss due to mechanical difficulties or errors.",

          "In a Deloitte research, almost half of the respondents from the manufacturing industry plan to invest $5Mn or more this year in blockchain technology. This clearly indicates that blockchain technology holds some value for manufacturing.",

          "The one area of manufacturing that could be immensely benefited by blockchain technology is supply chain management, with its endless line of paperwork and continuous auditing and tracking. The chain of custody of both raw materials and the finished products is handled through supply chain management which involves the use of a lot of manpower to handle the work in progress, track the finished products, prepare the necessary documents, ensure timely payments and what not.",

          " Supply chain management is an extremely important function of modern management which ensures the generation and transfer of value in the form of goods in the global market so as to enable competitiveness and survival. Blockchain technology can be integrated in the supply chain management which will lead to a reduction in errors and faults. A blockchain-powered platform can involve all parties in the supply chain. The specifications of the raw materials being sent by the supplier can be recorded on the blockchain which can be directly viewed by the manufacturer as soon as it is recorded. All the details can be cross checked by the manufacturer upon the receipt of the raw materials so as to ensure that the right type of goods have been sent and there hasn’t been any loss during the transit.",

          "The blockchain can also incorporate smart contracts, which would make the payments almost instantaneous as soon as the manufacturer records the receipt of the goods on the blockchain. Tracking of the goods will become easier and the need for physical updating will be reduced to a bare minimum. Blockchain will reduce the repetitive nature of the activities that need to be performed and it will most definitely lead to cost benefits for all the parties involved.",

          "One other avenue of manufacturing that has gained a lot of traction in recent times is 3D printing. 3D printing is a great way of manufacturing products using a ‘printer’ which prints the product with all three dimensions, layer by layer, based on the design uploaded on the computer. Blockchain technology can ensure robust IP rights protection. It can also protect the design from being tampered with and can provide access to only authorized devices (3D printers) and individuals. Through smart contracts, the 3D file can be sent to the authorized printer and printing can be done without the need of manual intermediaries in the process or involving the threat of intellectual property theft.",

          "The technology can also help deploy what is known as “distributed manufacturing,” a type of decentralized manufacturing in which geographically disparate manufacturing facilities are connected and coordinated through an IT infrastructure on the blockchain.",

          "The concept of internet of things (IoT) has been around for a while now. The idea of connecting all the devices/machines so as to enable smooth and quick information sharing among the machines themselves to facilitate seamless production and reduced wastage of time is what internet of things is roughly about. Experts in the manufacturing industry believe that IoT technology can greatly impact the sector. However, there are still a few that are associated with the IoT and include identification problems of the IoT devices and the scalability of the same. Blockchain technology can play a significant role in driving IoT in manufacturing.",

          "All the devices or machines can be registered on the blockchain so that a digital identity of the devices can be created and the need to verify them will be eliminated. It will also enable dynamic updating of information of the devices without having to re-integrate them in the IoT. The entire information regarding the devices on the blockchain could then be sent to all the involved parties to ensure complete transparency and verification of manufacturing information.",

What started off as nothing more than a limited collection of computing services, has now evolved into a highly-sophisticated ecosystem, rapidly emerging as the de-facto solution for Enterprise IT. Nearly a third of organizations are working with four or more cloud vendors. In other words, it seems that the future of IT isn't just cloud computing - it's Multi-cloud.",

          "Unfortunately, the majority of cloud providers would prefer that you don't consider multi-cloud at all, as it benefits them to keep you locked in. Ultimately, every CIO should have the freedom to control the future of their business. Whether you're considering multi-cloud deployments because you want to have more options, or you're interested in multi-cloud to create more productivity and minimize risk within your organization, there are a host of benefits to building for multi-cloud.
