All by forming a small team, clearing their schedules for a week, and progressing from problem to tested solution using a proven step-by-step methodology. Even better, let’s say that at the end of the week you’re able to take a peek into the future to see how customers react to a product before you invest all the time and expense of building the full-fledged thing.",

Built upon the methodology first introduced by Google Ventures, the Design Sprint is a proven process to validate your product vision before committing development resources.

We simplify at the same time that we add useful features which we believe is the trick of good product design.",
