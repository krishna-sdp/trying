        "Are you developing a digital strategy from scratch, revamping an old one or rolling out online campaigns? A clear media strategy helps you to build brand awareness, drive engagement, reach higher conversion, and/or reduce acquisition costs. Your media strategy is your roadmap, framework, and your guide to making sure that your marketing doesn’t happen in a silo and that it resonates with the right audience. It coordinates your marketing above and below the line and makes sure you will get the most out of your marketing budget.",

        "Our experts have over 15 years of experience with all key areas of marketing. Both online and offline, from search engine optimisation (SEO) to conversion rate optimisation (CRO), and from go-to-market strategies to social media management. We are also specialists in delivering compelling content marketing, PR, and PPC campaigns.",

        "Our starting point always consists of your business objectives, placing a dot on the horizon with a view on how to get there. This is the foundation of your roadmap. It includes acquisition, customer engagement, a media strategy and how to work across all channels. To reach people, it’s important to first know who they are and where they are. That’s why we start with a comprehensive analysis of your target audience and current customer base. Collecting data on their online behaviour gives us information to sketch the customer journey.",

        "Using our findings, we recommend a plan to address any gaps. We also highlight how to leverage short- and long-term opportunities to evolve your digital marketing approach. We can help you with implementing your strategy at the right time via the appropriate channels. This includes creating the best mix of owned, earned and paid media.",

We share weekly, monthly or quarterly reports which are accompanied by explanations of the impact, performance and forecasts of next steps.

Top positions for your most relevant and highly demanded keywords are the key to push your company growth forward and generate more revenue. On the basis of a long term SEO strategy, we are happy to increase your visibility in search and help you with strategic SEO consulting as well as operative SEO support!",

        "SEO is an online marketing channel with a very strong ROI. Compared to paid traffic such as Google Ads, display advertising or else, where every click generates costs, SEO offers a sustainable and cost-effective way of generating visitors. However, top positions are not guaranteed and without the right measures, success is a product of chance. As a qualified SEO agency, we analyse your website with regard to your individual characteristics and market conditions and develop an SEO strategy tailored to you. In this context, we always take a look at the profitability of the measures to be implemented in SEO consulting. Investment and results should always lead to a positive result.",

Whether you are searching for a full-service agency or just need someone for a shoulder view, we are happy and hungry to help. We prefer to start a collaboration with a common discovery workshop in order to get a common understanding of your goals and frame conditions. In order to help your business, you should focus on the optimisation of your prior landing pages and start at the point where your greatest ranking opportunities as well as sales potentials are. These priorities should be reflected within your content strategy, information architecture, and operative SEO measures. ",

        "Next to this business focus, our expertise has always been in technical SEO. Regardless of whether your website has a complex filter system or is programmed using a JavaScript framework such as React, AngularJS or else, we are happy to advise you and bring you to the top of Google and other search engines. But SEO is not only about robots, SEO is about making your website a wonderful place to visit and fulfil the needs of the user. Therefore, our vision is to work as an interdisciplinary unit and add the perspectives of paid media, data, and usability to our SEO work for you.",

Not to mention a whole lot more relevant and a whole lot more lucrative. It enables you to optimise your owned media, like email and landing pages, all along the customer journey of your target audience. All to reach your business goals.",
